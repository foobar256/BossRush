# Habbakuk (Boss Idea)

## Summary
Named after the legendary WWII pykrete aircraft carrier, Habbakuk is a massive, floating fortress made of reinforced ice and wood pulp. It combines the environmental hazards of an ice boss with the heavy firepower of a naval dreadnought.

## Identity / theme
- **Pykrete Colossus**: A dull, grayish-blue iceberg with visible steel plating, gun turrets, and rocket pods embedded in its frozen hull.
- **Unstoppable Momentum**: It moves slowly but carries immense weight, crushing anything in its path.
- **Industrial Winter**: The sound of churning engines mixed with cracking ice.

## What the player learns (skill test)
- **Inertia Management**: Navigating slippery surfaces while dodging high-speed projectiles.
- **Priority Targeting**: Deciding whether to dodge the slow frost fields or the fast-moving rockets.
- **Bullet Grazing**: Finding gaps in the cannon fire while sliding.

## Signature moments (setpieces)
- **Broadside**: The boss rotates and fires a massive volley of cannon shells from one side.
- **Rocket Salvo**: Several rocket pods emerge from the ice and fire tracking missiles.
- **Ice Breaker**: The boss surges forward, leaving a massive trail of slippery ice and crushing any pillars in its way.

## Phases
- **Phase 1: Escort Carrier**
  - Slow movement. Uses side-mounted cannons (bullets) and drops ice patches.
- **Phase 2: Heavy Cruiser**
  - Hull cracks, revealing rocket batteries. Begins firing salvos of rockets that track the player.
- **Phase 3: The Dreadnought**
  - The floor becomes entirely ice. The boss fires all weapons simultaneously in a desperate "final stand" pattern.

## How it escalates
- **Weapon Variety**: Transitions from simple bullets to tracking rockets.
- **Environmental Hazard**: Ice patches last longer and cover more area as the hull "leaks" frozen coolant.
- **Fire Rate**: Weapons fire faster as the boss's "engines" overheat.

## Telegraphs
- **Rocket Fire**: Red laser sights lock onto the player before rockets launch.
- **Cannon Broadside**: Turrets rotate and click loudly before firing.
- **Ice Leak**: Puddles of blue liquid appear behind the boss before they freeze into patches.

## Counterplay
- **Drifting**: Using the slippery floor to gain enough speed to outrun tracking rockets.
- **Cover**: Using ice pillars (if present) to block cannon fire, though rockets might arc around them.
- **Engine Vents**: Targeting specific "warm" spots on the hull for bonus damage.

## Why it’s fun
- The contrast between "slow" ice mechanics and "fast" military projectiles creates a unique rhythmic challenge.
- It feels like fighting a mountain that is also a battleship.
